# # Comparison Analysis:

# *Based on a comparison of precipitation and temperature between June and December from 2010 to 2017 across all observation stations, itâ€™s possible to notice the following statistical information:*


# - Over 7 years, there are 1574 precipitations occurred and 1700 temperatures  observed in June, higher than 1405 precipitations and 1517 temperatures  observed in December. The different (1700-1517 = 183) between two observations counts that indicate the data of Dec, 2017 not included in database.

# - Comparing of precipitation, the mean (0.217) and median (0.03) of December are higher than Juneâ€™s mean (0.136) and median (0.02), respectively. 

# - For precipitation derivative indicators, December also had higher Standard Deviations and Maximum precipitation. In December, standard deviation (0.541) is higher than Juneâ€™s standard deviation (0.336). The minimum of both December and June are zero, and December maximum (6.42) is higher than June (4.43).

# - Comparing of temperatures, it apparently shows that Juneâ€™s temperature indicators are higher than December.

# # Analysis Limitation Recommendation:

# 1. The lack of data in December, 2017  may cause less reliable of data. The database should generate more recently winter data to compare summer and winter precipitation. 

# 2. In addition of statistical summery, various features and plots may help us better analyze the seasonal weather. For example, line plots would be able to  provide quick and easy way to show time-varying. Histogram plots would tell us frequency of precipitation as well as temperature for both December and Jane.

# 3. For seasonal analysis, we need filter more detail precipitation and temperatures for Spring and Autumn.
