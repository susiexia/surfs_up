# Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data and plot the results. 
#Starting from the last data point in the database. 

# Calculate the date one year from the last date in data set.

# Perform a query to retrieve the data and precipitation scores

# Save the query results as a Pandas DataFrame and set the index to the date column

# Sort the dataframe by date

# Use Pandas Plotting with Matplotlib to plot the data

# How many stations are available in this dataset?

# What are the most active stations?
# List the stations and the counts in descending order.

# Using the station id from the previous query, calculate the lowest temperature recorded, 
# highest temperature recorded, and average temperature most active station?

# Choose the station with the highest number of temperature observations.
# Query the last 12 months of temperature observation data for this station and plot the results as a histogram

# Write a function called `calc_temps` that will accept start date and end date in the format '%Y-%m-%d'
